## Location-finder module for JKUAT institution

This is a module designed to be part of an application, and enables you to find locations of buildings and facilities in JKUAT.
The project is built on laravel framework. Here are the steps you can take to make it run on your system:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run composer update command in the root of the folder you have cloned the repo to (The folder that has the directory "app/" in it).
3. Still at the root of the folder, run  the command "php artisan migrate"- this will create tables for authentication and registration of users, as well as password reset. You will not have to create tables for yourself, it does it all for you!

**Please note that you need to locate the folder in the "htdocs" folder of your server if you are using Xampp. This is normally C:\xampp\htdocs"

Enjoy!!
